loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict
liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the Service or any products procured using the Service, or for
any other claim related in any way to your use of the Service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors
or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Service or any
content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Service, even if advised of their
possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for
consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum
extent permitted by law.

SECTION 14 - INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless LShield LLC. and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners,
officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and
employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third-party due to or
arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference or your violation of
any law or the rights of a third-party.

SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY
In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such
provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable
portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

SECTION 16 - TERMINATION
The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of
this agreement for all purposes.
These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of
Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site. If in
our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of
Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice, and you will remain liable for all amounts due
up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any
part thereof).

SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT
The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver
of such right or provision.
These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service
constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding
any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us
(including, but not limited to, any previous versions of the Terms of Service). Any ambiguities in the interpretation of
these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.

SECTION 18 - GOVERNING LAW
These Terms of Service and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the United States.

SECTION 19 - CHANGES TO TERMS OF SERVICE
